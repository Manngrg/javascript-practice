//loop that'll print out all even numbers between 10 and 40.

// for(let i=10; i>=10 && i <=40; i=i+2){

//     console.log(i);
// }

// create a variable "logged in" that starts off as false, create a forloop that loops while logged in is false , each loop prints "incorrect credentials", after 3 loops iteration change logged in to be true and after the loop is done , print out "succesfully logged in".
